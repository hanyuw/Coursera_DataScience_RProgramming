## Coursera R programming Assignment 2 Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        s <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(s)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(s)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        s <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(s)
        s
}
